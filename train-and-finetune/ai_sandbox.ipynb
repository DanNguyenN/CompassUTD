Skip to Main Footer. The University of Texas at Dallas Content Office of Undergraduate Advising Jonsson School students, we hear you! We are working to improve our response time to your emails. In the meantime, please help us by doing the following: Visit our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page. For information about courses and prerequisites, review our degree plans and flowcharts. For registration questions, email ecsregistration@utdallas.edu. For all other questions, email ecsugadvising@utdallas.edu. Do not email multiple addresses as it slows down the process. We are prioritizing registration for engineering and computer science students. If you are not an engineering or computer science student, you may begin enrolling in engineering and computer science classes on January 2, 2023. Other concerns? Reach out first to Irene Marroquin, director of advising. Then, if needed, email Dr. Stephen Crynes, assistant dean of student success. Please see below for the types of assistance we can provide by email and video chat. When to email the advisors: Clarify pertinent dates/deadlines Request to withdraw from a class Review degree requirements Submit forms or paperwork Questions regarding university or state policies Verify transfer credit When to set up an appointment: Discuss change of majors to and within The Jonsson School Discuss in-depth registration questions Review a semester by semester plan towards graduation Submit or Request TCEPS (Transfer Credit Earned Prior to UT Dallas that needs evaluation) Add a minor to your Jonsson School degree Fast Track information and applications Jonsson School Needs Transfer Mentors!!
